# bisque

Some git shortcuts I wrote in bash. There is a high chance that something better already exists but I didn't know.

But if you see something here you like feel free to use it however you like!

## Usage

Put the extra commands you want to use somewhere in your path. Git should pick them up as porcelain commands.
